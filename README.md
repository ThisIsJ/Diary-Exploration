## Features
### API Features
* API of the Daily Diaries with administration, date, year, and link to where it is available, image of entry if available.
* API to include complete information about the Entry (who, titles, what, where, significance, etc.)
* Layer for table of contents -- a listing of headers
* Layer for terms -- defined terms, including their scope


### Site Features
* Features a curated "on this day" rotating image/entry - 
  * similar in look to the article page at [readwrite.com] (http://readwrite.com/2014/10/07/ios8-installations-mediocre-software-apps)
  * image occupies most of landing page - full bleed extending to the fold
* Features image and transcript, if available
* Navigation is inobtrusive and minimal - similar in look to the article page at [readwrite.com] (http://readwrite.com/2014/10/07/ios8-installations-mediocre-software-apps)
* embeddable calendar widget
* Definitions: Call-outs for defined terms or individualsin the text; clicking them opens the term's definition in the sidebar.
* Search
  * One box keyword search with option of advanced search, similar to upper right [JFK website] (http://www.jfklibrary.org/) results are auto fill, and results are categorized by type
  * Date search - retrieve by date (month, day, and/or year)
* Responsive Design - The application design is responsive, adjusting to the device and screen size of the user.


* Calendar
  * Features the selected "On This Day" entries
  * Embeddable for other sites
  * Links to search box to discover other entries
  
* Citations
  * Ability to draw attention to specific sections of interest within entries
  * Inline annotations
  * Allow citations in the diary entries, and we display them as clickable links allowing easy navigation within a diary.
  
* Tool to Crowdsource Transcriptions
  * Most of the digitized daily diary entries are image-based PDFs or JPEGs. Very few are OCR.  
  * We want a tool that people can use to transcribe the text of the diaries.  
  * The crowdsourced transcriptions will be submitted for approval.  Upon approval, a transcript will accompany the image.
  
## Consideration
* Our holdings of Presidential diaries are diverse formats used by different administrations.
  * Handwritten diary entries by a President.
  * Handwritten appointment book by staff.
  * PDFs of typed Presidents' schedules. 
  * Some of the PDFs have OCR.
* Most entries do not have machine readable text.
* Content located at different websites of the Presidential Libraries, or our partner organizations.
